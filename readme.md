# jour75008: Data Skills for Community Reporting

The Newmark School's Social Journalism MA program aims to serve under-reported communities by meeting their information needs. Students choose a community to serve by building a sustainable media business, growing loyalty and establishing trust.

Data skills are critical to effective public engagement work. This course presents fundamentals of data-driven journalism including data gathering, data analysis, data visualization and data reporting.

Students in this program must be able to:
- Analyze geographic information and demographic data, plus interest and behavior metrics to uncover newsworthy stories about a community
- Analyze audience behavior data to inform design and offerings
- Gather and present credible information for a community
- Assess relevant outcomes

This course also addresses common pitfalls in misinterpreting data.
